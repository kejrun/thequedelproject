# Quedel

## About
This is a project in the course "Independent Project for STS" at Uppsala University made my Karin Svensson and Siri Eksvärd, two students from the Master Programme in Sociotechnical Systems Engineering. The main objective of this project was to develop a smart phone application or a web information system that lets users connect and preferably interact with other users.

What inspired us was the frequently asked question for almost every student in Uppsala, *How long is the queue at the student nations?*

The project resulted in the smart phone application Quedel. Quedel is an application that creates a platform where people can post estimations of the queuing time and interact with other estimations, in a live feed specific for each student nation.

## Run the app on a simulator
To be able to run Quedel on a simluator Xcode is required. This means that you need be be on a MacOS computer to be able to simulate the app. So, the first step is to install Xcode. The easiest way to install Xcode is via the Mac App Store. Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build the iOS app.

1. Install Node JS
2. Clone or download this repo
3. Navigate to the downloaded folder in a command line tool
4. Type ```npm install``` and wait while magic is installing the necessary libraries, which are specified in the file package.json.
5. Run the simulator with ```run react-native run-ios``` in the command line tool inside the project folder, or build the app directly in Xcode.

That should enable you to run Quedel on a simulator! If you have any trouble, check out this guide: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

**Enjoy!**
