# Quedel
This is a project in the course "Independent Project for STS" at Uppsala University made my Karin Svensson and Siri Eksv√§rd.

2018

# Getting started

1. Install Node JS
2. Clone or download this repo
3. Navigate to the downloaded folder in a command line tool
4. Type npm install and wait while magic is installing the necessary libraries, which are specified in the file package.json.
5. Install Xcode. The easiest way to install Xcode is via the Mac App Store. Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.
6. Run the simulator by writing run react-native run-ios in the command line tool inside your React Native project folder

That should enable you to run Quedel on a simulator! If you have any trouble, check out this guide: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
